# Sales Data Cleaning and Filtering with Python ðŸ“ŠðŸ§¹
Welcome to the Sales Data Cleaning and Filtering repository! This project focuses on cleaning and filtering sales data using an Excel file and Python scripts.

# Overview
The objective of this project is to provide a streamlined process for cleaning and filtering sales data to extract valuable insights. By leveraging Python's pandas library, we automate the data cleaning and filtering tasks, making the analysis more efficient and reproducible.

# Features
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize data formats for consistency.

Data Filtering: Filter sales data based on specified criteria such as date range, product category, or customer segment.

Excel Integration: Interact with Excel files directly using Python, allowing seamless data import/export.

Customization: Easily customize the cleaning and filtering process to suit your specific sales analysis requirements.

# Getting Started
To get started with cleaning and filtering sales data:

Clone or Download the Repository: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Prepare Your Data: Place your sales data in Excel format (e.g., sales_data.xlsx) within the project directory.

Run the Python Script: Execute the Python script clean_and_filter_sales.py to start the data cleaning and filtering process.

Review Output: Once the script completes execution, review the cleaned and filtered data either in the console or in the generated output files.
